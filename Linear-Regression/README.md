<h1>This project is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed.</h1>
<p>The dataset has details of 12261 lego sets with 9 features and 1 target variable. The dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc.</p>
<h3>The snapshot of the data  :</h3>

<p>Some of the features of review_difficulty, theme_name and Country Name in the data are textual in nature. Done behind-the-scenes data preprocessing and modified the data to build Linear Regression model.</p>
<p>After completing this project, I have the better understanding of how to build a linear regression model. In this project, I have applied the following concepts.</p>
<ul><li>Train-test split</li><li>
  Correlation between the features<br>
